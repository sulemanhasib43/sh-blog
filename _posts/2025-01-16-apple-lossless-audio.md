ALAC is a lossless audio codec developed by Apple Inc. for lossless compression of digital music. It provides bit-for-bit accuracy of the original audio data while reducing the file size compared to uncompressed formats like WAV.

ALAC was initially proprietary, but in 2011 Apple released it as open-source and royalty-free.

ALAC is primarily used in Apple's ecosystem, including iTunes, iOS devices, and Apple Music. It supports up to 8 channels of audio at 16, 20, 24 and 32 bit depth with a maximum sample rate of 384 kHz.

## ALAC vs FLAC

ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) and FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) are both lossless audio formats that preserve the full quality of the original audio without data loss. However, there are some key differences:

ALAC was developed by Apple and is primarily used within the Apple ecosystem, including iTunes and iOS devices. It offers seamless integration with Apple products but has limited compatibility outside of the Apple ecosystem.

In contrast, FLAC is an open-source since beginning, cross-platform format that is widely supported on a variety of devices and operating systems. FLAC files are generally slightly smaller in size compared to ALAC files, making them more efficient for storage and streaming.

While both ALAC and FLAC provide lossless audio quality, the choice between the two often comes down to device compatibility and personal preference. Apple users may prefer ALAC for its tight integration, while those with a more diverse device ecosystem may find FLAC to be the more versatile option.

## Sad Reality
Lossless audio only works on HiFi Wired Devices.
