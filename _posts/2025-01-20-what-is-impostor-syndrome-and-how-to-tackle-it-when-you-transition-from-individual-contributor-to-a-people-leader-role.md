_In the name of Allah the most merciful and most gracious._

Impostor Syndrome refers to a psychological pattern where  _individuals doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud, despite evidence of their competence_.

**Cause:**  One of the causes may root back to your childhood when your family stresses more on achievements and success. If your parents had extreme behaviours when you succeeded and failed i.e., overpraise and criticism you’re more likely to develop Impostor Syndrome later in your life.  [Be kind and soft spoken!](https://quran.com/3/159)  (So, (O Prophet) it is through mercy from Allah that you are gentle to them. Had you been rough and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you. So, pardon them, and seek Forgiveness for them. Consult them in the matter and, once you have taken a decision, place your trust in Allah. Surely, Allah loves those who place their trust in Him.) 💙.

## Tackle

When transitioning from an individual contributor role to a people leader role., consider the following strategies:

1.  **Recognise it:**  Be aware of the signs and symptoms of Impostor Syndrome. Acknowledge that these feelings are common and can be overcome. E.g., A common sign is when you accomplish something and designate the accomplishment to luck not realising your hard work and effort.  [Self-doubt and ultimate guidance!](https://quran.com/16/93)  (If Allah so willed, He would have made all of you a single community, but He lets whom He wills go astray and takes whom He wills to the right path; and surely you will be questioned about what you used to do.)🔎.
2.  **Understand your value:**  Remind yourself of the skills, experiences, and achievements that have led to your promotion. Recognise that you were chosen for the people leader role based on your abilities and potential. Mostly you’re offered a role which you’re already playing at an organisation and the Leadership team realises that potential, the title is just to make it official.  [Self-Realise!](https://quran.com/17/70)  (And We bestowed dignity on the children of ’Ādam and provided them with rides on the land and in the sea, and provided them with a variety of good things and made them much superior to many of those whom We have created.)😉.
3.  **Seek support and mentorship:**  Connect with other experienced leaders who can offer guidance and reassurance. Discuss your concerns and seek advice from individuals who have been through a similar transition. They can be your bosses from previous organisation or a friend who has stepped into similar role earlier then you and is more experience.  [Seek guidance!](https://quran.com/42/13)  (He has ordained for you people the same religion as He had enjoined upon NūH, and that which We have revealed to you (O prophet,) and that which We had enjoined upon Ibrāhīm and Mūsā and ‘Īsā by saying, “Establish the religion, and be not divided therein.” Arduous for the mushriks (polytheists) is that to which you are inviting them. Allah chooses (and pulls) toward Himself anyone He wills, and guides to Himself anyone who turns to Him (to seek guidance)) 🗺.
4.  **Embrace continuous learning:**  Recognise that transitioning to a people leader role involves acquiring new skills and knowledge. Be open to learning and seek opportunities for professional development and training. May be join a meet-ups of people leaders, build a circle around you of people with similar need and experiences, take trainings on Influence, Effective Communication, Listening, Delegation, etc. An important aspect which most people leader tend to forget is the stop gaining technical skills. Even though soft skills/people skills are important but don’t overlook the technical skills. Keep current with your field of core experience and expand on relevant areas.  [Explore the world!](https://quran.com/29/20)  (Say, “Go about in the land and look(observe) how He has originated the creation. Then Allah will create the subsequent creation. Surely Allah is powerful to do everything.”)📚.
5.  **Set realistic expectations:**  Understand that it’s normal to make mistakes and face challenges in a new role. Set realistic expectations for yourself and allow room for growth and learning. Setup a One-On-One with your line manager, discuss challenges and align the expectations. Ask for advice on the challenges and convey your perspective on deliverables and expectation. It’s okay to tell if a timeline is unrealistic for you.  [Keep your commitments](https://quran.com/70/32),  [stay upright in your testimonies](https://quran.com/70/33),  [protect the keys to treasure](https://quran.com/70/34)  and  [you will see the results](https://quran.com/70/35)! (and those who are careful about their trusts and covenants, and those who are upright in their testimonies, and those who take due care of their Salāh; Those will be honoured in gardens) 🤝.
6.  **Celebrate successes:**  Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements as a people leader. Take the time to reflect on your progress and the positive impact you are making on your team. Celebrate your achievements with your team and make them excited about it, this will be a good influence on your team while on the other hand, it strengthens your trust with the team. Do share the accomplishment with your line manager as well as their recognition will give you the highest motivation and they will share how you can carry such success to another level.  [Be Thankful!](https://quran.com/7/43)  (And Say “All praise is to Allah who has guided us to this. We would not have been able to find the way, had Allah not guided us. Surely, the messengers of our Lord came with the truth.”) 🏆.
7.  **Practice self-compassion:**  Be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion. Accept that everyone makes mistakes and is part of the learning process. Treat yourself with the same understanding and support you would offer to others. After all your life is a continuous learning journey, you either learn or you succeed.  [You’re only tasked with what you can handle!](https://quran.com/2/286)  (Allah does not obligate anyone beyond his capacity. For him is what he has earned, and on him what he has incurred.“Our Lord, do not hold us accountable, if we forget or make a mistake, and, Our Lord, do not place on us such a burden as You have placed on those before us, and, Our Lord, do not make us bear a burden for which we have no strength. And pardon us, and grant us forgiveness, and have mercy on us. You are our Lord. So then help us against the disbelieving people.”) 💚.
8.  **Surround yourself with a supportive network:**  Build a network of colleagues, mentors, or friends who can provide encouragement and support during this transition. Share your experiences and concerns with them.  [Be in the company of good people and stay away from toxic behaviors!](https://quran.com/9/119)  (O you who believe, fear Allah, and be in the company of the truthful) 😃.
9.  **Keep a record of positive feedback:**  Document positive feedback you receive from your team and colleagues. Refer to these testimonials during moments of self-doubt to remind yourself of your capabilities. Ask your colleagues for feedback on your HRMS(Human Resource Management Systems) so that when you’re reviewing your progress you’re reminded of your contributions. Also, you can ask your colleagues for recommendations on your work on LinkedIn.  [Express Gratitude!](https://quran.com/14/7)  ((Recall the time) when your Lord declared, “If you express gratitude, I shall certainly give you more, and if you are ungrateful, then My punishment is severe.”) 📈.
10.  **Focus on personal growth:**  Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your personal growth and continuous improvement. Set goals for yourself and work towards achieving them. Your personality is your Unique Selling Point (USP) enforce it. Besides work learning a new skill or developing habits they can be different their your professional skill.  [Learning new experiences!](https://quran.com/14/1)  (Alif, Lām, Rā. This is a book We have sent down to you, so that you may deliver the people, with the will of their Lord, out of all sorts of darkness into the light, leading them to the path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy) 📗.

Remember that transitioning to a people leader role is a process, and it takes time to adapt and gain confidence. By implementing these strategies and developing a growth mindset, you can overcome Impostor Syndrome and thrive as a people leader.
